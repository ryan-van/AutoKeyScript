# AutoKeyScript
## Main-Idea
This was originally used to create a script that auto fishes in the game Maplestory 2. Only works for windows currently and uses python3 along with ctypes in python. Allows for the computer to write directly to computer using Virtual-Key Codes to be able to choose. Timing specific to ~60fps, works on all fishing, timing can be changed to anything.
Has been adapted to quickly input certain strings for whatever needs to be automated, works well for autofill forms that repeat many times. Can also be used as a brute-force method to test different log-ons.
